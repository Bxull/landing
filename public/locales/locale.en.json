    "FAQ_Q2": "Do I need to write the ML model from scratch?",
    "FAQ_A2": "No, it's not mandatory. However, using fine-tuning, LoRA, custom loss functions, or task-trained models is considered a strong advantage.",
    "FAQ_Q3": "Is Python required?",
    "FAQ_A3": "Preferably, yes. Python is convenient for experimentation, training, and analysis. But the solution can also be done in JavaScript/TypeScript if the necessary tools are available.",
    "FAQ_Q4": "Can I train models locally?",
    "FAQ_A4": "Yes. You can run training and inference locally, in the cloud, via API, or on your own computing graphs.",
    "FAQ_Q5": "How long will the solution take?",
    "FAQ_A5": "Typically, creating a quality prototype takes 6–10 hours of active work, including experiments, testing, and model integration.",
